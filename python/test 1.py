<!-- In this problem, you'll be given a list of positive integers and a separate integer, k and tasked with finding whether there is a pair of integers in the list that sum to exactly k
Implementation
Implement the function find_sum_pair(numbers, k) which takes as input:
• a list of positive integers (numbers).
⚫ a positive integer (k), representing the target sum.
For example:
numbers [1, 5, 8, 1, 2]
=13
Your find_sum pair function should return a list of two integers, containing the indices of a pair of integers in the list that sum to k. Note that:
Onsole output
erPad
The first index of the list is 0.
The first integer in your output should represent the lower index.
[[0, 0] should be returned if there no pair is found.
In the case that there are multiple possible pairs that sum to the target, return the pair whose left index is the lowest. -->
